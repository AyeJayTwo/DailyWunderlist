Daily Email to Send Wunderlist Tasks

#Introduction
This project was created for a few reasons:
*Daily Emails*
I'm great at reading my email. Truly phenomenol. Staying on top of my tasks...not so much. Figured the best way to do this would be to wake up in the morning and review everything I had on my plate for that day and week.

While I had the option of plugging into something like Zapier, IFTTT, or other web services, we live in the era of 'make things'. So I figured I would make a thing. This also gave me a great excuse to learn a few other coding things.

*REST API*

No idea why everyone capitalizes it. Guess I'll learn it.

*Web App Deployment*

I've done a good job writing random scripts for small things here and there. I've never done anything that has been used by strangers. Terrifying.

TODO
- Make workflow so others can use the app
- Deploy this to a webserver
- Automate running this everyday
- Move from MailGun sandbox to production server
- Allow user to choose which lists get sent everyday
- Reorganize it away from list based to time based format
